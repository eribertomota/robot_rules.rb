robot_rules.rb
==============

third-party program robots_rules.rb

I don't intend to develop robots_rules.rb. The main goal of this
repository is publish a license (MIT) for robots_rules.rb, originaly
divulgated by James Edward Gray II here[1].

James sent me the license, via email, after I asked him. He used a
GPG signed message to do it (file permission.txt). The public key of
James is 7C2C7118.
